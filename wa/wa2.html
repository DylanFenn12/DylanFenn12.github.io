        Hello everyone! My name is Dylan. I use <em>he/him</em> pronouns. In this course, my ultimate goal is to be able 
        to create a genuine portfolio that I can link to the domain name that I have owned for <strong>YEARS!</strong> 
        I have much experience in C++, Arduino projects, Fusion 360, and 3D printing, but I hope to hone my skills as a CTD major
        and continue to grow!
