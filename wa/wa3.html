<p>Paintball is a competitive team shooting sport in which players eliminate opponents from play by hitting them with spherical dye-filled gelatin capsules called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paintball_equipment#Paintballs">paintballs</a> that break upon impact. Paintballs are usually shot using low-energy air weapons called paintball markers that are powered by compressed air or carbon dioxide and were originally designed for remotely marking trees and cattle. <br>
The game was invented in June 1981 in New Hampshire by Hayes Noel, a Wall Street stock trader, and Charles Gaines, an outdoorsman and writer. A debate arose between them about whether a city-dweller had the instinct to survive in the woods against a man who had spent his youth hunting, fishing, and building cabins. A friend of the pair chanced upon an advertisement
 for Nel-Spot cattle marking guns in a farm catalogue and they were inspired to use it to settle their argument. Shortly after they participated with 10 other men in a capture the flag competition they called the first annual "Survival Game". One hundred acres of forest in New Hampshire were divided in to four quadrants and participants were tasked with collecting a 
 flag from each quadrant and returning to a home base. A forester named G. Ritchie White collected the four flags to win in two hours and fifteen minutes. Many initial public reactions to the game were negative, believing that hunting other humans with realistic but non-lethal guns was "sick", "macho", and "perverted".</p>

The paintball equipment used may depend on the game type (e.g., woodsball, speedball, scenario), on how much money one is willing to spend on equipment, and on personal preference. However, almost every player will utilize three basic pieces of equipment:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Paintball marker: also known as a "paintball gun", this is the primary piece of equipment, used to mark the opposing player with paintballs. The paintball gun must have a loader or "hopper" or magazines attached to feed paint into the marker, and will be either spring-fed, gravity-fed (where balls drop into the loading chamber), 
or electronically force-fed. Modern markers require a compressed air tank or CO<sub>2</sub> tank. In contrast, very early bolt-action paintball markers used disposable metal 12-gram (0.42 oz) CO<sub>2</sub> cartridges also used by pellet guns. In the mid to late 1980s, marker mechanics improved to include constant air pressure and semi-automatic operation.
Further improvements included increased rates of fire; carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) tanks from 100 to 1,180 ml (3.5 to 40 US fluid ounces), and compressed-air or nitrogen tanks in a variety of sizes and pressure capacities up to 34,000 kPa (5,000 psi). The use of unstable CO2 causes damage to the low-pressure pneumatic components inside electronic 
markers, therefore the more stable compressed air is preferred by owners of such markers.</li>

<ul>
<li>Paintballs (pellets): Paintballs, the ammunition used in the marker, are spherical gelatin capsules containing primarily polyethylene glycol, other non-toxic and water-soluble substances, and dye. The quality of paintballs is dependent on the brittleness of the ball's shell, the roundness of the sphere, and the thickness of the fill; higher-quality balls 
are almost perfectly spherical, with a very thin shell to guarantee breaking upon impact, and a thick, brightly colored fill that is difficult to hide or wipe off during the game. Almost all paintballs in use today are biodegradable. All ingredients used in the making of a paintball are food-grade quality and are harmless to the participants and environment. 
Manufacturers and distributors have been making the effort to move away from the traditional oil-based paints and compressed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide">CO<sub>2</sub></a> gas propellant, to a more friendly water-based formula and compressed air in an effort to become more "eco-friendly". Paintballs come in a variety of sizes, including of 13mm (0.50 in) and 17mm (0.68 in).</li>
<li>Mask or goggles: Masks are safety devices players are required to wear at all times on the field, to protect them from paintballs. The original equipment used by players were safety goggles of the type used in labs and wood shops; today's goggles are derived from skiing/snowboarding goggles, with an attached shell that completely covers the eyes, mouth, 
ears and nostrils of the wearer. Masks can also feature throat guards. Modern masks have developed to be less bulky compared with older designs. Some players may remove the mouth and/or ear protection for aesthetic or comfort reasons, but this is neither recommended nor often allowed at commercial venues. A good paintball mask will protect the eyes from vision 
distortion caused by fogging, glare, and scratches. Players who do not wear a paintball mask can suffer serious injury.</li>

<p>Paintball is played with a potentially limitless variety of rules and variations, which are specified before the game begins. The most basic game rule is that players must attempt to accomplish a goal without being shot and marked with a paintball. A variety of different rules govern the legality of a hit, ranging from "anything counts" (hits cause elimination
whether the paintball broke and left a mark or not) to the most common variation: the paintball must break and leave a mark the size of a US quarter or larger. Eliminated players are expected to leave the field of play; eliminations may also earn the opposing team points. Depending on the agreed upon game rules, the player may return to the field and 
continue playing, or is eliminated from the game completely. The particular goal of the game is determined before play begins; examples include capture the flag and elimination. Paintball has spawned popular variants, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodsball">woodsball</a> which is played in the natural environment and spans across a large area. Conversely, the variant of speedball 
is played on a smaller field and has a very fast pace with games as brief as two minutes fifteen seconds in the (NSL) or lasting up to twenty minutes in the <abbr title="Paintball Sports Promotions">PSP</abbr>. Another variant is scenario paintball, in which players attempt to recreate historical, or fictional settings.
</p>
<h3>Tournament</h3>
<p>Tournaments are skill based competitions. These are often bracket tournaments with 5 person teams, taking place on Speedball (paintball) fields. Tournaments such as the <abbr title="National Xball League">NXL</abbr> hold different events throughout the summer months all over the United States with a range of skill divisions. Other series such as the Ultimate Woodsball League (UWL) play tournaments with 
large teams on large wooded fields. The types of tournaments and applicable skill divisions vary wildly to serve the diverse interest of paintball competitors. <br>
The <abbr title="Central Premier Paintball Series">CPPS</abbr> is the leading paintball tournament event in the UK and only hosts tournament style paintball. Everything is played on sup air fields (inflatable bunkers on flat grass) and games are timed and scored.</p>

<p>Speedball is played in an open field that could be compared to a soccer field, it is flat with a minimum of natural obstacles, and sometimes artificial turf is used, especially in indoor fields. The first speedball fields were constructed with flat wooden obstacles staked into the ground to provide cover; this concept was further developed into a number of 
urban-scenario field styles with larger building-like obstacles for casual play, but speedball itself progressed to using smaller obstacles made from plastic drainage pipe, which offered a more variable field layout and some "give" to the obstacles for increased safety. This style of play was often referred to as "Hyperball". Eventually, inflatable fabric "bunkers" 
were developed based on common obstacle shapes from previous fields, such as "snake" and "can" bunkers. Often referred to as "Airball", the use of these inflatable obstacles both increases player safety by reducing potential injury from collisions with obstacles, and allows them to be easily moved to reconfigure the field or to set up temporary fields.</p>
<h3>Woodsball</h3>
<p>Woodsball, or "Bushball", is a fairly recent term that refers to what was the original form of the game: teams competing in a wooded or natural environment, in which varying amounts of stealth and concealment tactics can offer an advantage. The term is commonly used as a synonym for specialized scenario-based play, but it technically refers to virtually any form 
of paintball played in fields primarily composed of natural terrain and cover such as trees and berms, instead of manmade obstacles. Usually the gamemode is team death match although some times it is capture the flag, or protect the president (where one player is chosen as the "president", the president's team must protect the president, the enemy team must eliminate the president).</p>

<p>Paintball is played at both commercial venues, which require paid admission, and private land, both of which may include multiple fields of varying size and layout. Fields can be scattered with either natural or artificial terrain, and may also be themed to simulate a particular environment, such as a wooded or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area">urban area</a>, and may involve a historical context. Smaller fields (such as 
those used for speedball and tournament play) may include an assortment of various inflatable bunkers; these fields are less prone to cause injury as the bunkers are little more than air bags, which can absorb the impact of a player colliding with them. Before these inflatable fields became available and popular, speedball fields were commonly constructed of various rigid building materials,
such as plywood and framing timber, shipping pallets, even concrete and plastic drainage pipe. The use of plastic pipe tethered with stakes became common, as it allowed for relatively easy reconfiguration of fields and at least some impact-absorption, and was the precursor to the modern inflatable bunker (in fact, certain common features in inflatable fields, such as "can" and "snake" bunkers,
 were derived from similar features built with plastic drainage pipe). Recreational fields still commonly use these older materials for their higher durability and novelty; inflatable bunkers are prone to bursting seams or otherwise developing holes and leaks. Other fields have wooden or plastic barriers.</p>

<p>The rate of injury to paintball participants has been estimated as 45 injuries per 100,000 participants per year. Research published by the Minnesota Paintball Association has argued that paintball is one of the statistically safest sports to participate in, with 20 injuries per 100,000 players annually, and these injuries tend to be incidental to outdoor physical activity (e.g. trip-and-fall). 
    A 2003 study of the 24 patients with modern sports eye injuries presenting to the eye emergency department of Porto São João Hospital between April 1992 and March 2002 included five paintball eye injuries. Furthermore, a one-year study undertaken by the Eye Emergency Department, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston has shown that most sports eye injuries are caused by basketball, baseball,
     hockey, and racquetball. Another analysis concluded that eye injuries incurred from paintball were in settings where protective equipment such as masks were not enforced, or were removed by the player. Eye injuries can occur when protective equipment is not properly used and such injuries often cause devastating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_loss">visual loss</a>. For safety, most regulated paintball fields strictly enforce a 'masks-on' policy, and most eject players who consistently disobey.</p>
